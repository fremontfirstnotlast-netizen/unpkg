## UNPKG

Welcome to UNPKG!

UNPKG is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm. Use it to quickly and easily load any file from [npm](https://npmjs.com) using a URL like:

```
https://unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file
```

Where `:package` is the package name, `:version` is the version range, and `:file` is the path to the file in the package.

You can [learn more about UNPKG on the website](https://unpkg.com).

## Development

This repository contains the production source for UNPKG. There are 5 packages:

- [`unpkg-www`](./packages/unpkg-www/) is the main UNPKG website and package file CDN worker
- [`unpkg-app`](./packages/unpkg-app/) is the package browser app worker
- [`unpkg-esm`](./packages/unpkg-esm/) is the `esm.unpkg.com` package import worker for browser-ready ESM, CSS modules, import maps, and inline TS/TSX transforms
- [`unpkg-files`](./packages/unpkg-files/) is the Bun file server backend that fetches npm tarballs, extracts files, and builds ESM artifacts for the workers
- [`unpkg-worker`](./packages/unpkg-worker/) is the shared TypeScript library used by the workers and the files backend

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for workspace tooling and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for the runtime and tests. Install these first.

Next, install all dependencies and run the tests:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

Then start the file server and each worker, plus the asset servers for the two HTML apps:

```sh
pnpm --filter unpkg-files dev
pnpm --filter unpkg-www dev
pnpm --filter unpkg-www dev:assets
pnpm --filter unpkg-app dev
pnpm --filter unpkg-app dev:assets
pnpm --filter unpkg-esm dev
```

The local services listen on these ports:

- `unpkg-www`: `http://localhost:3000`
- `unpkg-app`: `http://localhost:3001`
- `unpkg-esm`: `http://localhost:3002`
- `unpkg-files`: `http://localhost:4000`

## Deploying

The `unpkg-files` backend is deployed on [Fly.io](https://fly.io). You'll need an account.

Next, adjust the Fly config in `packages/unpkg-files/fly.json` (you'll need your own app `name`) and deploy:

```sh
pnpm --filter unpkg-files run deploy
```

To deploy the workers, you'll need a [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account. You will also need to (1) edit the `wrangler.json` file in each worker and update its [`routes`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to your own domain(s) and (2) adjust each worker's environment `vars` (in `wrangler.json`) so they can find one another in production.

For API token authentication, create a local `.env.local` file from `.env.example` and set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. The worker deploy scripts load `.env.local` automatically before invoking Wrangler. Use a token with the Cloudflare permissions needed for the operation you are running, such as worker deploy permissions for deploys and cache purge permissions when purging CDN entries.

Once you've done that, you can deploy all workers with:

```sh
pnpm run deploy:workers
```

Or deploy each worker individually with:

```sh
pnpm --filter unpkg-www run deploy
pnpm --filter unpkg-app run deploy
pnpm --filter unpkg-esm run deploy
```
